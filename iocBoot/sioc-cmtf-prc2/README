DESCRIPTION

This IOC is set up with minimal SLAC specific features. It should be useful for
testing in any environment, e.g. other labs.

CONFIGURATION

There are a series of environment variables at the top of st.cmd. The comments
there describe how to use them and what valid values are.

If your system architecture isn't linux-x86_64, change #! at the top of st.cmd if
you want to start the IOC by invoking ./st.cmd. If you're runnign and building on
the same machine, use ../../bin/[architecture name].

SLAC specific autosave and iocAdmin hooks are commented out. Uncomment them in
st.cmd and ../../configure/RELEASE to enable.

Different labs have different ways of defining the environment needed to make
channel access talk on the network. SLAC's are in the soft_pre_st.cmd scripts
in other IOC directories.

SLAC uses soft_post_st.cmd at the end of startup scripts to dump possibly
useful information into files. This IOC doesn't do that by default.

RUNNING

Make st.cmd executable. Start the IOC by calling ./st.cmd

To start the ioc on a different executable architecture, execute the command
    ../../bin/[architecture]/scllrf st.cmd
