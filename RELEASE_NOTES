scllrf-R1-0-13: Adding a PV for loaded Q based on decay waveforms

scllrf-R1-0-12: Two new sequencers: Use "Extremum Seeking" to find minimum
				reflected RF, and monitor ADC board voltages

scllrf-R1-0-11: RF on/off behavior improved, consistent with SRF

scllrf-R1-0-10: Add power waveforms and average. Fix trip limit scaling. Phase balance seq.

scllrf-R1-0-9: Adding History module support for diagnostics and improved automation.

scllrf-R1-0-8: CW detune refinements.

scllrf-R1-0-7: Make CW detune work for buncher.

scllrf-R1-0-6: Fixing CW detune calculations.

scllrf-R1-0-5: Fixed status and processing settings in links.

scllrf-R1-0-4: Gun and buncher deployment

scllrf-R1-0-3: RFS waveforms scale with number of samples per point.
			Calculating average of amplitude and phase waveforms, and
			offering waveforms which average N previous waveforms.
			I/Q waveforms are now enabled in pairs, no reason to enable
			just one or the other.
