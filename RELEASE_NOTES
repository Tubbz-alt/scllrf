scllrf-R1-0-21: Speed up frequency following loop. Make it triggered by new detune calculation.

scllrf-R1-0-20: newmat10 is not thread safe. Adding mutexes to make sure only one thread at a time uses it.
		Also adjusting exception handling to make sure bad data is not used or sent to PVs.

scllrf-R1-0-19: Added soft trip on high reflection level mid-pulse. Naming convention change.
				CATERs 1400006, 1400094, 141451, 141450,141473

scllrf-R1-0-18: Also migrating to EPICS 7
scllrf-R1-0-18-RC2: Hard coded which forward phase to use in CW detune. Experimental
				frequency correction. Phase mean calculation uses mean I and Q to avoid
				wrapping problems.
scllrf-R1-0-18-RC1: Reducing number of points for decay detune calc; buncher decays faster,
				was using noise for part of calculation. Test release.

scllrf-R1-0-17: Fixing "detune good" calculation. Use standard devitation of phase waveform,
				not last 300 phase means

scllrf-R1-0-16: Temperature tuning PID loop improved with PWM type control.

scllrf-R1-0-15: Added archive files.

scllrf-R1-0-14: Added buncher tuning PID loop, various small improvements based on ops

scllrf-R1-0-13: Adding a PV for loaded Q based on decay waveforms

scllrf-R1-0-12: Two new sequencers: Use "Extremum Seeking" to find minimum
				reflected RF, and monitor ADC board voltages

scllrf-R1-0-11: RF on/off behavior improved, consistent with SRF

scllrf-R1-0-10: Add power waveforms and average. Fix trip limit scaling. Phase balance seq.

scllrf-R1-0-9: Adding History module support for diagnostics and improved automation.

scllrf-R1-0-8: CW detune refinements.

scllrf-R1-0-7: Make CW detune work for buncher.

scllrf-R1-0-6: Fixing CW detune calculations.

scllrf-R1-0-5: Fixed status and processing settings in links.

scllrf-R1-0-4: Gun and buncher deployment

scllrf-R1-0-3: RFS waveforms scale with number of samples per point.
			Calculating average of amplitude and phase waveforms, and
			offering waveforms which average N previous waveforms.
			I/Q waveforms are now enabled in pairs, no reason to enable
			just one or the other.
